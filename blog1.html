        <h1>We’re About to Witness the Great Cryptocurrency Reset</h1>
        <h3>The crypto movement is destroying itself</h3>

                <sup> <strong>WHEN</strong> </sup> the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto published his white paper in 2008, it
                was
                just a mere
                document, describing
                a new, unique payment system he called Bitcoin. Yet, even though he did not portray any particular
                narrative
                inside, it prompted an entire generation of financially repressed citizens into believing that digital
                currencies might solve their ever-increasing monetary woes.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span>
                We began to perceive the Bitcoin network as a revolutionary economic tool, one that used sound money to
                create a more equal society through enhanced financial freedom and liberty. It was the new, rebellious
                way
                to stick it to the man, an escape pod that detached ourselves from the clutches of a financially
                repressive
                regime, and, best of all, a gigantic “screw you” to those who architected its rise and our descent into
                the
                monetary chaos.
            </span>

            <br>
            <span>
                Since then, the financial media has fed us a constant stream of crypto narratives, most declaring that
                the
                world is moving closer toward this brighter, more sovereign, more liberating future that Nakamoto
                indirectly
                sold to us. We’ve seen the rise of <a href="https://cryptohead.io/research/crypto-fluencers/">crypto
                    influencers</a>, or “cryptofluencers”, who often cheer things like:
                “The fiat system is collapsing!”, “Bitcoin is financial freedom!”, “Central bankers and Wall Street are
                literally shaking in their boots!”
            </span>
            <br>
            <span>
                Except, there’s one small problem with these narratives. None are coming true or have played out in
                reality.
                Instead, they have matured into carefully constructed fictions, disguising how Bitcoin has failed at
                almost
                everything Nakamoto set out to achieve. Since the crypto ecosystem keeps blurting out a non-stop stream
                of
                “freedom porn”, we’ve failed to notice that the crypto movement, though it started out with good
                intentions,
                has gradually mutated into the same regressive paradigm the existing elites have promoted for decades.
            </span>

            <br>
            <span>Nakamoto had designed Bitcoin to eliminate the middleman, mostly Wall Street banks, state financial
                institutions, and mega-corporations, which most citizens loathe and despise. Bitcoin has succeeded in
                doing
                this, but it has failed to create any of the delicious freedom, equality, and liberty it had promised.
                Rather, only a few individuals have truly benefited from the crypto boom. <mark>In fact, a new power has
                    risen
                    alongside the existing financial aristocracy: the crypto elite, who’s secretly formed a monopoly
                    behind the
                    scenes</mark>.</span>
